\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for keyword suggestion and
query expansion.
We also conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our approach and 
%It can also be applied to general text modeling tasks over corpus of
%short text snippets without any modification.
the experiment results show that our approach can successfully select
relevant yet not so obvious bid phrases for a given query no matter
the query is popular or rare.
Since most existing approaches exploiting historical data can't be
applied to tail queries, this fact confirms that directly making use
of semantic knowledge is helpful for sponsored search.
%reveal that modeling a corpus of shot text
%snippets with the help of rich common sense knowledge is an effective
%way.
Besides, our approach outperforms ESA that also model
text snippets as explicit concepts, which gives approval to both
Probase and conceptualization algorithm proposed in this paper.
%However, our conceptualization approach is highlighted by WSD phase
%which leverages large scale co-occurrence network not so elegantly.
%We will continue to seek conceptualization approach that absorbs the WSD phrase
%into our inferrence phase and functions in an purely probabilistic
%way.
