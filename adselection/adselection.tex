\begin{abstract}
  Sponsored search is the main source of revenue of a search engine.
  Advertisers bid on phrases for their advertisements, and search
  engines match user queries to relevant ads based on the bid phrases.
  Since both queries and bid phrases are short texts and cannot be
  modeled by the standard bag-of-words approach, most existing
  approaches exploit user behavior data (e.g., click-through data,
  session data, etc.) to fill the semantic gap in matching bid phrases
  and user queries. This approach however cannot handle tail queries
  which do not have much user behavior data.  Although individually
  rare, tail queries as a whole account for a considerable portion of
  the query volume and are a significant source of search engine's
  revenue.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for matching
  queries and bid phrases.  Leveraging a probabilistic taxonomy and a
  large scale term co-occurrence network, we conceptualize a short
  text to a set of relevant concepts.  To handle millions of queries
  and billions of bid phrases, we create a semantic index of
  concepts: relevant bid phrases are selected for a given query by
  measuring their similarity in the concept space.  We conduct a
  series of experiments including expanding 30 million queries with
  0.7 billion phrases.  Experiment results show the effectiveness of
  our approach.
